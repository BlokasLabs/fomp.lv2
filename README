This is an LV2 port of the MCP and VCO LADSPA plugins by Fons Adriaensen.

It features more precise plugin descriptions (in particular, CV ports are
distinct from audio ports, and unit metadata is available), but otherwise
remains faithful to the originals.  The code is identical to the original
LADSPA versions except for some type changes which should not affect output.
These plugins should be sonically indestinguishable from the originals.

Documentation for each plugin is included in the plugin's data file, and should
be available as online help in the host interface.
